    sentences:
    - I'm glad to have made it safely up here, however, I think my minutes are numbered.
      I only hope that if I write this down someone may find me, or save me, or kill
      that THING. That awful creature.
    - There's a door in the library, at the back wall, however I still havent been
      able to find a key. There's so many books in there its hard to figure out where
      it might be hidden, but one of them has to have some kind of indication about
      where this key is.
    - Knowing this lurker, it's probably hidden by some kind of "gift," a puzzle.
      He seems to like tricks far too much.
    - 'I hear him looking for me, I need to sneak back to the library. The next book
      I''m reading is "Master''s Table."

      I...really hope it''s the right one.'
