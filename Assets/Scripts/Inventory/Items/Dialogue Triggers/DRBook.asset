    sentences:
    - The Master's table was one to behold, tall was his top hat as he sat at the
      head. He was cleancut, dressed to the nines in purples and blacks, ready to
      enjoy a hearty meal with his family.
    - His first lady, golden locks to his right, and his second all but worn to his
      left. Both of them despised each other, the first obviously more favoured this
      year, but they'd do anything for their Lord Master. Even if it meant tolerating
      another dumb family meal.
    - The awful son sat at the end, very underdressed, and the dapper sat beside
      the first. The dapper one had smarts and pride up the wazoo, something the
      awful never achieved. Never will to be frank. He wasn't smart, nor did he dress
      well. Dapper stays dapper, awful stays awful for this meal.
    - The maid, who was lucky to eat that evening, sat on the far side, watching
      them eat what she worked so hard on. Her hands worn from the day spent in preperation,
      eyes weary from the work. Watching them from afar, she felt little joy. The
      maid alone, trapped in a home.
    - With nothing of her own.
