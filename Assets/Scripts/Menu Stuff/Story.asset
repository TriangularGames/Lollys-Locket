  story: 'Lolly is a young girl, with a lot of spunk. She is loved by her family,
    well taken care of, and strong at heart.


    Her mother died when she was very
    young, and one thing that always brought her joy in times of hardship was her
    mothers locket. It is gold, beautiful, shiny, and the most well kept thing that
    she owns.


    In recent days, it has gone missing.


    She discovered through
    some rumors, that a vampire in the hills known only to others as Master Alistar,
    might''ve been stealing recently.


    Despite her worries, and the rumors of
    his supposed killings, she knew that her mother''s locket needed to be saved.


    So
    off she went.'
