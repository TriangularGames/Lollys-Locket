  story: 'And with the door slamming behind her, narrowly making her escape. Lolly
    was freed, with locket in tow.


    She continued to run, until the mansion
    was barely in view. It was a sore thumb, so dark and gloomy, against the now
    rising sun. She had no idea she''d been gone so long.


    Gripping the locket
    tightly and putting it around her neck, she headed home.


    Happy that her
    mom was still with her.'
